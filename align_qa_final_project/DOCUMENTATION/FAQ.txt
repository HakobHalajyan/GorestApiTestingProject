*** Authentication ***


headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)



It is impossible to obtain an access token not being logged into the system.


After getting the token for the first time it is possible to sniff request url in order
to be able to refresh and get a new token without visiting goRest website.
Makes no sense because token is valid for a substantial amount of time.

Refresh Example:

URL: https://gorest.co.in/my-account/access-tokens/86767/refresh 
# where 86767 is probably unique id for particular user

Method: POST

Body: {
  "authenticity_token": "miR9CAFT32-_Z3qxE4vk8pABqcdMMdMj3sxwawLL5WB1xPj3ddQmGDodP2Z-582asZBV_pL4Zy3Br3NdRrbUeA"
}


Response is a webpage with <td> containing token
